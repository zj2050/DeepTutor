## ⚠️ Contribution Requirements
[!IMPORTANT]
All contributions must be based on the `dev` branch!
1. Fork the repository and clone it locally.
2. **Synchronize**: Always pull from the `dev` branch before starting:
   ```bash
   git checkout dev && git pull origin dev
   ```
3. **Branch**: Create your feature branch from `dev`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
4. **PR Target**: Submit your Pull Request to the `dev` branch (not `main`).
5. **Validation**: Ensure all pre-commit checks pass before submitting.

## 🛠️ Code Quality & Security
We use a suite of automated tools to maintain high standards of code quality and security. These are configured via `pyproject.toml` and `.pre-commit-config.yaml`.

### Our Toolstack
- **Ruff**: High-performance Python linting and formatting.
- **Prettier**: Consistent formatting for frontend and configuration files.
- **detect-secrets**: Scans for high-entropy strings and hardcoded secrets.
- **pip-audit**: Scans dependencies for known vulnerabilities (V3.x compatible).
- **Bandit**: Analyzes code for common security issues.
- **MyPy**: Static type checking to ensure code reliability.
- **Interrogate**: Reports docstring coverage. While it won't block your commit, please aim for high coverage.

[!TIP]
Before submitting a PR, you MUST run:
```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```
While local pre-commit hooks are configured to be lenient and may only show warnings, the CI will perform strict checks and will automatically reject PRs that fail.

## 🔒 Security Best Practices
### File Uploads
- **Size Limits**: General files are capped at 100MB; PDFs are capped at 50MB to prevent resource exhaustion.
- **Validation**: We enforce multi-layer validation (Extension + MIME type + Content sanitization).
- **Sanitization**: All filenames are sanitized to prevent path traversal attacks.

### Development Standards
- **Subprocesses**: Always use `shell=False` when calling subprocesses to prevent command injection.
- **Pathing**: Use `pathlib.Path` for all operations to ensure cross-platform (Windows/Linux/macOS) compatibility.
- **Line Endings**: LF (Unix) line endings are enforced for critical scripts via `.gitattributes`.

## 💻 Coding Standards
To keep the codebase maintainable, please follow these guidelines:
### Python Guidelines
- Use Type Hints for all function signatures.
- Prefer f-strings for string formatting.
- Follow PEP 8 (mostly enforced by Ruff/Black).
- Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility.

### Documentation
- Every new module, class, and public function should have a docstring.
- Use the Google Python Style Guide for docstring formatting.
- Update `README.md` if your change introduces new features or configuration variables.

## ⚙️ Development Setup
<details>
<summary><b>Setting Up Your Environment (Recommended)</b></summary>

**Step 1: Create a virtual environment**
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

**Step 2: Install dependencies**
```bash
pip install -e ".[all]"
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Setting Up Pre-commit (First Time Only)</b></summary>

**Step 1: Install pre-commit**
```bash
# Using pip
pip install pre-commit

# Or using conda
conda install -c conda-forge pre-commit
```

**Step 2: Install Git hooks**
```bash
pre-commit install
```
Hooks will now run automatically on every commit.

**Step 3: Initialize the Secrets Baseline**
If you encounter new "false positive" secrets (like API hash placeholders), update the baseline:
```bash
detect-secrets scan > .secrets.baseline
```
</details>

### Common Commands
| Task              | Command                                        |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Check all files   | `pre-commit run --all-files`                   |
| Check quietly     | `pre-commit run --all-files -q`                |
| Update tools      | `pre-commit autoupdate`                        |
| Emergency skip    | `git commit --no-verify -m "message"` (Not recommended) |

## 📋 Commit Message Format
We follow a structured commit format to maintain a clean history:
```
<type>: <short description>

[optional body]
```
- `feat`: A new feature (corresponds to a MINOR version bump).
- `fix`: A bug fix (corresponds to a PATCH version bump).
- `docs`: Documentation only changes.
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (formatting, missing semi-colons, etc).
- `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature.
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests.
- `chore`: Routine tasks (updating build processes, etc).

## 💡 How to Get Started
1. Browse our [Issues](https://github.com/HKUDS/DeepTutor/issues) for tasks labeled `good first issue`.
2. Comment on the issue to let others know you're working on it.
3. Follow the process above and submit your PR!
